             Why don't we discuss the plot about this one game like other game reviews that were released by Jagat Play in the past? Because basically, Valve doesn't load single player mode with a story base for Counter Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) at all. It is presented as an MMOFPS game, which is more focused on a competitive multiplayer experience. The gameplay mechanism itself is not much different than the previous Counter Strike series, where you will act as a Counter-Terrorist and Terrorist and engage in an epic war to ensure each other's victories. The maps provided will also still come with their unique missions, although most of them revolve around bomb detonation and hostage rescue.</p><br>

            <p>One that is unique from CS: GO, despite the appearance that is now changing much better, it still exudes the aura of classic CS that is so thick. If you have played CS series in the past, then you will immediately get a familiar feeling that is so thick when playing this latest series. What cause? The presence of some iconic maps in the past might be one of the elements that will leave that first impression to you. Classic maps such as Dust, Dust 2, Italy, Inferno, Train, to Aztec are presented in the same design form, as we already know. However, that does not mean Valve does not modify these maps at all. Some maps get a significant overhaul with the addition of extra lines to ensure a more balanced and dynamic battle between the CTs and the Terror. Some simple elements such as boxes / drums which are commonly used for cover and camping are now shifted, removed and added. But basically, these folders remain iconic battle maps that you've known for a long time.
